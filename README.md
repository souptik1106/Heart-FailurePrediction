# Heart-FailurePrediction

This was a project allotted to me as my final project in a Data Science and ML/AI Training offered by IIT Roorkee. 

This project is a typical binary classification where in we need to predict heart failure. 

A detailed working and summary can be found in the PDF uploaded where you'll find my approach, the working and the interpretation of results and a conclusion.
